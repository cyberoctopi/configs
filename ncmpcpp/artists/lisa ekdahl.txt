Lisa Ekdahl (born July 29, 1971) is a Swedish singer and song writer in popular music. She has so far published ten albums, six of them in Swedish and four in English. 
She moved into an more jazzy direction after she decided to do what she felt was more Lisa. She had a great role in 2004 when she was invited to the reunion at club Montmartre in Copenhagen.
