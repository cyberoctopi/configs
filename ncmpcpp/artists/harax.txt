Project "Harax" has been started in 2006 with my first track entitled "Light". That track was crafted at my home studio with a strong flavor of Nord Lead, my favorite synth of all everything.

"Light" and the following "chill trance" or "morning trance" tracks has been played by fellow djs in local clubs, collecting positive feedback and settled good base to further works, developed intention to write well composed, harmonic music.

Soon enough I've met Valery Kuznetzov (Sol) and Konstantine Savchenko (Castaneda), members of Solcast project. In process of excitingly positive and educative collaboration we've created Solcast version of Light, presented at Club 117, amongst Infected Mushrooms, SynSUN, Zymosis tracks, played there.

Getting new relations through the psyshine.org.ua, chill.org.ua and the net in general. Participation in Skygravity fest further enlarged my circle of acquaintance.

The style of the project has been worked out - classic trance sound with melodic, lyrical part added. Almost no samples, except for the drums and a bit of atonal noises. Eventually recording and processing guitar parts. Falling in love with analog sound - good set of generators and filters provides insanely wide palette of timbres, driving people crazy with either tenderness or fury.

2007, February 14. First release. Ukrainian chill projects compilation "Fantazma". Produced in Kyiv by Sentimony Records. Dj Divex, Dj Alienatix, Dj Lorenzo playing my tracks all around.

In 2008, "Trancersguide to the galaxy" ezine, included Harax project into the list of successful Ukrainian chill-trance collectives.
