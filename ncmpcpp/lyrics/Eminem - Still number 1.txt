Peace to Thirstin Howl, A. L., and 
Wordsworth

My mother smoked crack I had a 
premature birth

Iâm just a nerve cursed with badly 
disturbed nerves

You wanna be the one to step up 
and get served first

99% of aliens prefer
earth

I come here to rule the planet, 
starting with your turf

I hid a secret message inside of a 
word search

With smeared letters runnin' 
together in blurred spurts


I hang with male chauvinist pigs
and perverts

Who point water pistols at women
and squirt shirts

Been a bad boy since diapers and 
Gerber's

My first words were bleep bleep and 
curse curse

Never had it and I still donât 
deserve dirt

My breath still stinks and Iâm on 
my third cert

Yanking out my stitches, and hollering "nurse nurse,

You said this shot would numb it, 
chick it just hurts worse!"
