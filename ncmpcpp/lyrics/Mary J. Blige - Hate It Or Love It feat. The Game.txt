When you learn stepped in this game
After "What's The 411?", things ain't been the same
And I can't complain,
But with all this fame comes a whole lot of pain
But I'm so glad to be here
And my music's still sincere
Lets get back to the story,
All of this pain and glory
And 94 was "My Life" and my life wasn't right
So I reached out to you and told you what I've been through

[Chorus: 50 Cent] + Mary J.
(Hate it or love it the underdogs' on top
and I'm gon' shine, homey until my heart stop)
Go head and envy me, I'm a soul hip-hop queen
and I ain't goin' nowhere but you already know me
(Hate it or love it the underdogs' on top
and I'm gon' shine, homey until my heart stop)
Go head and envy me, I'm a soul hip-hop queen
and I ain't goin' nowhere but you already know me

And I came and "Shared My World"
But at that point I was just a foolish girl
Tryin to find my way
And I dropped a "Mary" album and people would say
That it's just not gonna work and my feelings they did hurt
But my fans showed me so much love and I owe it all to them
Then I came with "No More Drama", I remember that week
It was when Aaliyah died, I couldn't hardly sleep
Thought about it every day,
And it made me change my ways
I'm a real woman, now because of all of these days
[Chorus: 50 Cent] + Mary J.
(Hate it or love it the underdogs' on top
and I'm gon' shine, homey until my heart stop)
Go head and envy me, I'm a soul hip-hop queen
and I ain't goin' nowhere but you already know me
(Hate it or love it the underdogs' on top
and I'm gon' shine, homey until my heart stop)
Go head and envy me, I'm a soul hip-hop queen
and I ain't goin' nowhere but you already know me
[Bridge]
Find me of a "Real Love"
You don't have to worry ("Real Love")
"All Night Long" "I'm Goin' Down"
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-da
Do-do-do-do-do-da
"Reminisce" on the love we had
"You Are Everything" "Talk About A Limit"
What are you gonna do without "My Life, My Life, My Life, My
Life"
[Chorus: 50 Cent] + Mary J.
(Hate it or love it the underdogs' on top
and I'm gon' shine, homey until my heart stop)
Go head and envy me, I'm a soul hip-hop queen
and I ain't goin' nowhere but you already know me
(Hate it or love it the underdogs' on top
and I'm gon' shine, homey until my heart stop)
Go head and envy me, I'm a soul hip-hop queen
and I ain't goin' nowhere but you already know me
(Hate it or love it the underdogs' on top
and I'm gon' shine, homey until my heart stop)
Go head and envy me, I'm a soul hip-hop queen
and I ain't goin' nowhere but you already know me
(Hate it or love it the underdogs' on top
and I'm gon' shine, homey until my heart stop)
Go head and envy me, I'm a soul hip-hop queen
and I ain't goin' nowhere but you already know me
