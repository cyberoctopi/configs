No, I don't remember what brought us to this
What places we blindly passed, what turns we missed
When things really mattered and we really cared
When simply being was easy, just having you there

I was on a down slide, wasting my days
When I met you I came to such a lovely place
We laughed and cried our way through
The days and nights, the weeks and months
And all the seasons, ups and downs

Remind me of how I used to feel
Remind me of who I used to be back when
Nothing could come between us then
That thought would never leave us

'Cause I don't remember, love needles in the hay
The life I knew by heart and lived everyday
The secret codes and signs, you and I, eye to eye
Wake me up, hurt me, you have to
I forgot how to cry

Remind me of how I used to feel
Remind me of who I used to be back when
Nothing could come between us then
That thought would never leave us

So remind me of how I used to feel
Remind me of who I used to be back when
Nothing could come between us then
That thought would never leave us when
Nothing could come between us then
That thought would never leave us
