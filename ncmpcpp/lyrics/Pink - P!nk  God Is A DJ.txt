I've been the girl with her skirt pulled high
In the outcast never running with mascara eyes
Now I see the world as a candy store
With a cigarette smile, saying things you can't ignore
Like mommy I love you
Daddy I hate you
Brother I need you
Lover, hey, fuck you
I can see everything here with my third eye
Like the blue in the sky

If God is a DJ life is a dance floor
Love is a rhythm you are the music
If God is a DJ life is a dance floor
You get what you're given
It's all how you use it

God I've been the girl, middle finger in the air
Unaffected by rumors, the truth I don't care
So open your mouth and stick out your tounge
You might as well let go you can't take back what you've done
So find a new lifestyle
A reason to smile
Look for nirvana
Under the strobe lights
Sequins and sex dreams
You whisper to me there's no reason to cry

If God is a DJ life is a dance floor
Love is a rhythm you are the music
If God is a DJ life is a dance floor
You get what you're given
It's all how you use it


You take what you get and you get what you give
I say don't run from yourself, man that's no way to live
I've got a record in my bag you should give it a spin
Lift your hands in the air so that life can begin

If God is a DJ
If God
Say if God is a DJ
If God
God is a DJ
Then life is a dance floor
If God is a DJ
Get your ass on the dance floor now

If God is a DJ life is a dance floor
Love is the rhythm you are the music
If God is a DJ life is a dance floor
You get what you're given
It's all how you use it

If God is a DJ life is a dance floor
Love is the rhythm you are the music
Then you are the music
If God is a DJ the life is a dance floor
You get what you're given
It's all how you use it

If God is a DJ life is a dance floor
You get what you're given
It's all how you use it
If God is a DJ life is a dance floor
Love is the rhythm you are the music
If God is a DJ life is a dance floor
You get what you're given
It's all how you use it
