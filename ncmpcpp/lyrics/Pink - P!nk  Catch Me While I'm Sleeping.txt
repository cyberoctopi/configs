How many times have you sat across from me?
And how many times have you told me you were leaving
I'm, I'm not trying to listen
It was all the same

      

And why, why, why are you constantly believing that I, I?
I could ever give you what you needed
Baby baby please don't put your faith in me
I don't know what to say
'Cause it's all a dream to me anyways

You can catch me while I'm sleepin' darling
While I'm dreamin' too
It's a lonely, lonely, lonely place for me baby
It must get lonely for you too

And people always fallin' in and out of love
It can be pretty painful too
And maybe ohh maybe I'm just not strong enough
Sad but true so tell me why I see you so

You can catch me while I'm sleepin' darling
Oh maybe while I'm dreamin' too
It's a lonely, lonely, lonely place for me baby, oh

It must get lonely for you too

Catch me when
So catch me while I'm sleepin', yeah, yeah
I'm in my dreams
Catch me when I fall asleep
When I'm dreaming too
Catch me when I fall asleep
So catch me while I'm sleepin', yeah, yeah

Catch me while I'm sleepin' on
Maybe while I'm dreamin' too, yeah
It's a lonely, lonely, lonely place for me baby
It must get lonely for you too

So catch me while I'm sleepin'
Maybe while I'm dreaming too, uhh
It's a lonely, lonely, lonely place for me baby
It must get lonely for you too

Dadada dadada
Catch me while I'm falling
Dadada dadada
Dadada dadada
Dadada dadada
Dadada dadada
It's a lonely lonely lonely lonely place for me
Dadada dadada
Dadada dadada
It must get lonely for you too
It's ok
