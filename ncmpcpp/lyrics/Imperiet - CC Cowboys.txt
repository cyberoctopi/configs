Let's build Rome in a day
They king talled the tart
Come roll your dice and play
Let's change history la la la
So cheers gentlemen
Next time it'll be the stars
Kalashnikov comrades are calling from the grave
Coca Cola Cowboys and now we know what to say
Hello, hurray! We are the great
We are the soldiers of the human race
Hello, hurray! We are the great
We are the soldiers of the human race
The east US in west USSR
The world looks better
From the bulletproof cars
Will the new they need
It's just like in the movies
Accept that is for free
Kalashnikov comrades are calling from the grave
Coca Cola Cowboys and now we know what to say
Hello, hurray! We are the great
We are the soldiers of the human race
Hello, hurray! We are the great
We are the soldiers of the human race
We know it's best for you
We're dancing on your rations
With our leather boths
Giving you protection
Ripping of your root
Don't play the hero
There's nothing you can do
An empire will rise
Of media and of you
Hello, hurray! We are the great
We are the soldiers of the human race
Hello, hurray! We are the great
We are the soldiers of the human race
We know it's best for you
