No Big Deal

ow I'm gonna let it show

ou've got me down

ut I won't stay low

'll make my point

'll rub it in

'll watch you slip out of your skin


ou're no big deal

ut of style and out of class

now what I mean

our name will never last


 can't wait 'til I get back

nto action and attack

oesn't matter what you say

ey, what's your mission anyway


ou're so afraid of losing it

ut you're more afraid of showing it

o good manners, no social skills

ust vanity and overkill
