An attempt to a simple, pleasant and professional looking theme for GTK1.x and GTK2.0.

The color scheme is loosely based on Solaris/CDE.

It requires the current version of LighthouseBlue engine:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/lighthouseblue/

To make this work with the LighthouseBlue engine 0.4, as packaged in Debian unstable for example, edit ~/.themes/Sunhouse/gtk-2.0/gtkrc and comment out the three marked lines.
