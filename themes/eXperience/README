Readme for the eXperience theme
---------------------------------------------------------

Name:		eXperience
Release:		3.03
Author:		David Christian Berg

3.03
Added right-to-left support and moved all the icons into the icontheme.

3.02
There is an option to print out the path of a widget. This is very handy for adjusting the style-bindings in the gtkrc. It has been implemented in 3.0 but I forgot to document it. Simply run a program from the terminal with "EXPERIENCE_PRINT_WIDGET_PATH=TRUE" set.
Other than that: The ComboBoxes have been fixed. I'm not sure, why I made them look the way they did. I actually believe there was a change in GTK. Also there were many bugs with the Notebooks. I'm not sure, why I haven't noticed them before. Probably the top Extentions were right and only all the others screwed up. Furthermore I changed the orientation of the handles because it they switched them in Bonobo (was a patch) and also gave them a larger padding because I think it looks a little nicer

3.01
The bug with the inconsistant state of the Radiobuttons and Togglebutton has been fixed. Also the Statusbarbutton has gotten minor improvement in form of bugfixing.
Futhermore some adjustments to a minor change in the engine have been made.

3.0
With this release all the benefits of a completely new engine are weaved into the code. A big thank you to my brother Benjamin, who did all the coding of the engine with respect to my suggestions and needs -- I believe he actually did more work for this new release than I did myself. The new themes might be slightly slower, but the advantage of being able to change color easily is so huge, that I was more than willing to take this slight drawback. The new engine is a branch (eXperience-engine) of the eXperience project.
To change the color scheme, open the colorscheme file within the gtk-2.0 folder and run the respective comand that you'll find at the bottom of the document. Of course you're welcome to create your own color scheme.

All icons I and images I created are published under GPL.

Feel free to improve the theme and the icon set (esp. I need more Icons). I'd be glad to receive suggestions improvements and such.

Contact me if you have any questions!

TO DO (Last updated 2005-02-08)
---------------------------------------------------------

- More, a lot more own icons and redo some. (esp. complete the stock icon set!)

- The bug about handle orientation needs to be fixed in Gtk. (Patch is in the Tracker -- Bonobo is fixed now!)

- The Gnome pannel should have a gtk_shadow, to be themable. I filed a bug agaist the gnome-panel.

- Redo the buttons and background  of panel drawers as soon as the panel is fixed.

- Try to make a focus for textviews and the such, that looks like the textentry focus (Can't work, I filed a bug agaist Gtk)
