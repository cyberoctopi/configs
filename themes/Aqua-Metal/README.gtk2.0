5.  art.gnome.org for having all those wonderful themes for gnome.

About the theme:
----------------

This is theme inspired from the splash screen Aqua-Metal. It was initially based
on the Smokey-Blue theme. I modified most of it to suit this theme. so kudos to
Paul for that. It is suppose to be a theme with a metal background with aqua 
embedded in it. But metal background didn't look good coz gtk seems to tile
the picture and u can't stretch it. ah well i think it looks good this way
though.
Hope u people like it. 

If someone wants to change the theme 
a little bit like a purple coloured Aqua-Metal make sure u name it 
Aqua-Metal-Purple so that people won't have a hard time identifying. 

Any comments or bugs please email me.

Do visit my website for any updates on the theme. This theme is covered under
GPL so u know the drill.

Bugs:
-----
None so far.
