GitM v. 2 
GitM (Gorillas in the Mist) is a recoloring of the default Mist theme
with the Ximian palette and "Accent Yellow Dark" as the selection 
color. It plays well with the Gorilla Sawfish/Metacity theme, and 
requires the Mist engine by Dave Camp. This tarball also includes the 
theme for GTK1.

Changes from the previous version include:
button and menu padding updated to the newest Mist engine
prelight color changed to a light orange (Accent Yellow Light)
secondary scrollbar down button (gtk-2 only)


I'm trying to get a secondary scrollbar button in the gtk1 version,
but I haven't found the right command/engine to do that yet.

If you want to change back to the old prelight color, read the gtkrc.
