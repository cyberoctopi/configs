fishpie, gtk2 theme by greg jones <greg@fixedgear.org>


this theme is derivved completely from "fishing the sky" by paul hendrick.  all i did was change the pngs.  i have included the original readme below.

this theme goes pretty well with the "meta marker" theme for metacity, just like the original.

About

This is my first ever gtk theme, hopefully, it doesn't show ;)
It's based on the *bubble themes for gtk2

I made this theme after i created "Meta Marker", a theme for 
Metacity. IMO, these themes look pretty good together.
