Readme for the eXperience theme
---------------------------------------------------------

Name:		eXperience
Release:		3.0
Author:		David Christian Berg
Email:		david@sipsolutions.com

With this release all the benefits of a completely new engine are weaved into the code. A big thank you to my brother Benjamin, who did all the coding of the engine with respect to my suggestions and needs -- I believe he actually did more work for this new release than I did myself. The themes might be slightly slower to me, but the advantage of being able to change color easily is so huge, that I was more than willing to have this slight drawback. The new engine is a branch (eXperience-engine) of the eXperience project.
To change the color scheme, open the colorscheme file within the gtk-2.0 folder and run the respective comand that you'll find at the bottom of the document. Of course you're welcome to create your own color scheme.

All icons and images are published under GPL.

Feel free to improve the theme and the icon set (esp. I need more Icons). I'd be glad to receive suggestions improvements and such.

Contact me if you have any questions!

TO DO (Last updated 2005-01-02)
---------------------------------------------------------

- More, a lot more own icons and redo some. (esp. complete the stock icon set!)

- The bug about handle orientation needs to be fixed in Gtk.

- The Gnome pannel should have a gtk_shadow, to be themable. I filed a bug agaist the gnome-panel.

- Redo the buttons and background  of panel drawers as soon as the panel is fixed.

- Try to make a focus for textviews and the such, that looks like the textentry focus (Can't work, I filed a bug agaist Gtk)
