Theme: CoolGorillaInTheMist

Author: Todd Morgan

Inspiration: Mist and CoolGorilla

Purpose: 

I wanted to create a theme like Mist with the same color 
scheme as the CoolGorilla Theme. I like CoolGorilla, but on my old 
machine the Industrial theme engine is rather sluggish. By using the very 
fast Mist theme engine I was able to create a very fast theme that has the 
same colors as CoolGorilla.

I hope you like it.

All credit for Mist and CoolGorilla should go towards there appropriate artists.
This CoolGorillaInTheMist theme is just a theme hack. :)
