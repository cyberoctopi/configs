BlueSmooth - Smooth-engine based GTK theme
Sean Middleditch <elanthis@awesomeplay.com>
-------------------------------------------

CREDITS
=======

  This theme is derived from the Smooth-Winter theme, and utilized the Smooth
  theme engine.  Smooth-Winter is by Link Dupont (link@subpop.net)
  and presumably his copyright.

  The colours of this theme are taken from Bluecurve theme from RedHat.

ABOUT
=====

  The smooth theme is incredibly good looking and very professional feeling.
  The themes available for the Smooth engine so far, however, are a little
  less than professional; this is mostly, I believe, due to the colours used
  by them.  Bluesmooth uses a more common and professional feeling set of
  colours.

  Additionally, these colours are more neutral.  The slightly blue tinted
  Smooth-Winter, or other common Smooth themes, do not blend in well with
  various backgrounds, web pages, and so on.  Bluesmooth uses the neutral
  grey colour common to desktop toolkits, and doesn't clash with "mismatching"
  colours nearly so much.

  Bluesmooth does use blue (as per the name) for highlights; while another
  shade of grey was better for neutrality, it made the theme feel dead and
  drab, which _partly_ defeats the purpose of using a slick theme engine.

GOAL
====

  I'd like to see this theme, or a similar one, utilized as the default for
  GNOME, or perhaps even GTK itself; the current defaults are very very dated
  feeling.  This theme adds new life to otherwise boring GTK themes.

  This is all thanks to the most excellent work on the Smooth engine by its
  authors.

  Thank you!

MISCELLANY
==========

  * Yes, this theme was more or less 0-effort; copy the Smooth-Winter gtkrc
    files, copy in the Bluecurve colours, call it a day.
  * This README took more effort by many times than it did to make this theme,
    not including the hours poured into it by the Smooth author(s).
  * Contrary to popular belief, I am not a hampster.
  * What's on the outside _does_ matter.  Let's have GNOME have a "pimpin'"
    default theme, eh people?  ;-)
