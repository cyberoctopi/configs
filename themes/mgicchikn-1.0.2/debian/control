Description: Magic Chicken theme for GTK+ 2.x
 This package contains a "Magic Chicken" 'theme' that allows you to configure
 the look of GTK+ 2.x-using programs. The programs need no
 modifications to use themes; the support is built in to GTK+ 2.x.
 .
 Magic Chicken is an experimental theme which borrows much in terms of looks
 from the default Gtk+ 2.x theme, as well as from ThinIce and other funky
 themes. It is a good engine to work upon for cutting-edge looking themes.
