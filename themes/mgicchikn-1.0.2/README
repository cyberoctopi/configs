Magic Chicken GTK+ 2.0 Engine
===============================================================================

ABOUT
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Magic Chicken Engine is a theme engine for GTK+ 2.0. It supports
theme-selectable drawing styles and shadows for every widget and every state.
It also includes the MagicChicken and OkayishChicken themes, which use the
engine. MagicChicken is a Crux-style theme using the teal-green colors of the
Crux Teal Nautilus theme. OkayishChicken is a rough copy of the PrettyOkayish
theme by Tigert <URI:http://tigert.gimp.org/>. It was written by James Cape
<jcape@ignore-your.tv>.


THEME FORMAT
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Directives:
-----------
The following theme directives are valid inside the "mgicchikn" engine
specification.

	shadow[STATE][SHADOW-STYLE] = SHADOW-STYLE
		Set the shadow style for a particular widget state and *default*
		border/shadow style.

	shadow-width[STATE][SHADOW-STYLE] = INTEGER
		How wide to draw the selected shadow. Useful with a SHADOW-STYLE of
		FLAT, or to get "thin" shadows. Currently only 1 and 2 are supported.

	grippy-style[STATE][SHADOW-STYLE] = { GRIPPY-STYLE, DECIMAL-PERCENTAGE }
		How to draw grippies (for pane widgets, etc.) based on the widget state
		and current shadow style. The decimal percentage is what proportion
		of the widget in question to cover with the grippy.

	font-shadow[STATE] = SHADOW-STYLE
		What type of shadow to use when drawing text using freetype for a
		particular widget state. Currently, only IN and ETCHED_IN is supported.

	font-underline[STATE] = UNDERLINE-STYLE
		Whether or not and/or how to underline text in a particular widget/state.

	stock-image-brightness[STATE] = DECIMAL-NUMBER
		What level to adjust the brightness of stock (menuitem/toolbar/button/
		dialog) icons. A level of 1.0 means "do not adjust the level of the
		original icon." A level of 0.0 will render the icon entirely in black.

	stock-image-saturation[STATE] = DECIMAL-NUMBER
		What level to adjust the saturation (grayscale <-> colors) of stock
		(menuitem/toolbar/button/dialog) icons. A level of 0.0 will make an
		icon grayscale, and a level of 2.0 will "oversaturate" an icon, so it
		looks almost neon. A level 1.0 means "do not adjust the colors in the
		original icon."

	stock-image-transparency[STATE] = DECIMAL-NUMBER
		What level to set the transparency of a stock (menuitem/toolbar/button/
		dialog) icon to. A level of 0.0 will make an icon invisible (completely
		transparent). A level of 1.0 will not adjust the transparency of the
		original icon at all.

	check-image[STATE][SHADOW-STYLE] = FILENAME
		What image to use for GtkCheckButton indicators (the actual check box).

	radio-image[STATE][SHADOW-STYLE] = FILENAME
		What image to use for GtkRadioButton indicators (the actual radio dot).
