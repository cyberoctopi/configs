Munja runs on the Smooth & XFce Engine(s).
If you have any trouble using Munja, then more then likely you are either missing the engine or need to upgrade it.

Smooth 0.5.8
http://sourceforge.net/projects/smooth-engine/

XFce 2.1.10
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/xfce/gtk-xfce-engine-2.1.10.tar.gz?download

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The theme is set to be installed system wide under /usr/share/themes/ for an installation under any other location, you will have to do some editing. Start yr favorite text editor & open /Munja/gtk-2.0/iconrc, from there change the pixmap path to the current install path.

example: pixmap_path "/usr/share/themes/Munja/gtk-2.0/stock"
or
example: pixmap_path "/home/#USERNAME$/.themes/Munja/gtk-2.0/stock"
