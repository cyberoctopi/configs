This metacity theme, or rather....color scheme, was created by the clearbox app.
You can get it at gnome-look.org. Thanks Hugo for this great cutomizer!

I created it with the blue-eyed colors because all the current metacity themes
turned out a very ugly shade of blue, and this was the quickest, easiest fix to
enable gnome users to have a metacity theme that matched the blue-eyed gtk.
