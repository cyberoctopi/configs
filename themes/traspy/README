Traspy 1.0
============

Hi, this is my first GTK 2 theme, I hope you'll enjoy it! All the images has been drawn from scratch using Sodipodi and The Gimp (a special thanks to developers who are working on these projects). The "brave" color scheme that I've used on this theme could be cool or terrific for you i think. If you don't like it, you can change it (spend some time playing with the "gtkrc" file in the "gtk-2.0" folder and/or in The Gimp :)).
