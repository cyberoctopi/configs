<b><u><h1><i>PenOSmaster</i>, a purple GTK theme</h1></u></b>
By Patrick May.<br><br>
Yo wazzup my fellow GNOME users and people on the internet!!!<br>
I am MAY, PATRICK MICHAEL. And this is <b>PenOSmaster</b>, my own colour scheme for GTK 2.0 and GTK+.<br>
I hacked it together by looking through other gtkrc files, some trial and error, and a fair amount of time.<br>
It's based on a custom colour scheme I made for myself on Windows, which I used a lot. I missed it after I switched from windows, so I made this.<br>
I hope people would like it.<br><br>

Let me tell you. This is released under the <b>GNU General Public license.</b><br><br>

<b><i><h2>OH YEAH!!!</h2></i></b>
<img src=".dusthillguy_large.gif"><br><br>
Just extract to <b>~/.themes</b>, or use the gnome-theme-selector to install the file.<br><br>

Any suggestions or comments that you'd like to let me know? I'd be happy to hear them. My email address is dusthillresident@gmail.com.<br><br>

Good luck, and have happy times in your lives.<br>
