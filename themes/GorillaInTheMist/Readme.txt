Theme: GorillaInTheMist

Author: Todd Morgan

Inspiration: Mist and Gorilla

Purpose: 

I wanted to create a theme like Mist with the same color 
scheme as the Gorilla Theme. I like Gorilla, but on my old 
machine the Industrial theme engine is rather sluggish. By using the very 
fast Mist theme engine I was able to create a very fast theme that has the 
same colors as Gorilla.

I hope you like it.

Disclaimer:
All credit for Mist and Gorilla should go towards there appropriate artists.
This GorillaInTheMist theme is just a theme hack. :)
