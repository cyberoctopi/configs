For best results, you must install the magic chicken engine (mgicchikn).
I'm using Arial font-size = 9 for applications and window title. Looks best I think.

ajgenius is thinking about implementing the transparency and satruation feature within the smooth engine. If he does, I'll be going with that later on.

All icons and images are published under GPL.

Feel free to improve the theme and the icon set. I'd be glad to receive suggestions improvements and such.

Contact me if you have any questions!
