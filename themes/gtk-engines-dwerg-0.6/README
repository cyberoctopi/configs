Welcome to dwerg version 0.2

This theme-engine was based on a skin made my Everaldo <everaldo@everaldo.com> for trillian, I've stole the code from the cleanice engine and this theme still shares some code with it. So; thanks to Everaldo and the authors of Cleanice.

To install just fo the following (well known) magic:

./configure [--prefix=/where/you/installed/gtk2]
make
make install

Then either use the Gnome Control Center to select the theme or put the
following into your ~/.gtkrc-2.0 :

gtk-theme-name = "dwerg"

Have fun!
