gtk-flat-theme
===========

Original author: Mark Slicker <jamess1@wwnet.com>
Ported to GTK+ 2.0: Scott Barnes <reeve@ductape.net>

This theme engine gives gtk+ a flattened appearance with elements
taken from the MacOS and Metal uis. Modified from the default and
metal theme engines; the colors and background pixmaps are fully
customizable.
