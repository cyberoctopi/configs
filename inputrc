### Notes for horizontal-scroll-mode:

# 11:20:06 ▏  woldrich I return two strings; return ('Use of Device Identity in HTTP-Enabled Location Delivery', 'Design Guidelines. A.
#                      DeKok, Ed., G. Weber. ');      and when I tabcomplete, I get this output:
# 11:20:13 ▏ shadowpas Someone at 83.177.28.44 pasted "Design Guidelines. A. DeKok, E" (1 line) at http://scsys.co.uk:8002/93910
# 11:20:39 ▏     mauke can you post a testcase?
# 11:20:52 ▏  woldrich sure
# 11:24:12 ▏ shado "woldrich" at 83.177.28.44 pasted "testcase" (24 lines) at http://scsys.co.uk:8002/93911
# 11:25:36 ▏  woldrich mhm. It seems that's intended. But I dont want a tab seperating the suggested completions, I want a \n.
# 11:26:07 ▏     mauke works here
# 11:26:13 ▏     mauke I don't get tabs
# 11:26:15 ▏  j_wright yeah, its an \n here
# 11:26:22 ▏  woldrich awesome.
# 11:26:30 ▏  woldrich So what implementation are you using?
# 11:26:30 ▏     mauke it's not a tab
# 11:26:37 ▏     mauke it's a formatted list of possible completions
# 11:26:45 ▏     mauke the exact output depends on your terminal width
# 11:27:04 ▏     mauke and the length of the strings, of course
# 11:27:27 ▏  woldrich mhm? I get the exact same output whatever my width is.
# 11:27:40 ▏  j_wright maybe something in your .inputrc?
# 11:28:14 ▏  woldrich I changed PERL_RL to zoid. Now, it works like it should.
# 11:28:22 ▏  woldrich ... but of course, I dont want to use that
# 11:28:55 ▏  j_wright whats in your ~/.inputrc?
# 11:28:57 ▏  woldrich the Perl implemention also works like it should
# 11:29:04 ▏  woldrich j_wright, ah...
# 11:29:28 ▏  chitsubr is it fairly common to want a perl REPL? I'm coming from python and am used to having a REPL to play around in.
# 11:29:35 ▏  woldrich j_wright, I love you
# 11:29:54 ▏  woldrich thanks a lot guys.
# 11:30:07 ▏  chitsubr actually I should say perl interactive prompt to be precise
# 11:30:10 ▏  woldrich chitsubr, http://japh.se/all/perl/2011/01/22/re.pl/
# 11:30:40 ▏  woldrich another lesson learned: dont put random stuff in random config files and forget about it
# 11:30:47 ▏  j_wright heh
# 11:31:21 ▏  j_wright because i don't use bash, my .inputrc has 'set editing-mode vi'
# 11:31:22 ▏  woldrich see,  set print-completions-horizontally on
